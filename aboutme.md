My name is Renato Soares. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

I am an experienced teacher and examiner specializing in international curricula such as [IB, IGCSE, A-Levels, etc.]. I offer personalized, one-on-one online tutoring to help students build confidence, master key concepts, and reach their academic goals.

I teach entirely online using a digital whiteboard, interactive tools, and online calculators to make each session clear, engaging, and effective—just like a real classroom, but more flexible.

Whether you're preparing for exams or need regular academic support, I provide structured, results-focused tutoring tailored to your learning style.

Let’s work together to make progress you can see.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
