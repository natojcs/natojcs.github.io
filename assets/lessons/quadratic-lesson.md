# The Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is used to solve equations of the form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

The solution is given by:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

### Example

Solve the equation:

$$
2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0
$$

Using the formula:

- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 3 \)
- \( c = -2 \)

Substitute into the formula:

$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4(2)(-2)}}{2(2)} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{25}}{4}
$$

So:

$$
x = \frac{-3 + 5}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-3 - 5}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2
$$

### Conclusion

The quadratic formula is a reliable method for solving any quadratic equation.
